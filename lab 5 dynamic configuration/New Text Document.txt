The first ping often gets lost after configuring dynamic routing due to ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and/or route convergence delays. Here's why:

1. ARP Resolution
When a host sends the first packet to a destination, the sender may not know the MAC address of the next-hop device.
The ARP process is triggered, where the device sends an ARP request to resolve the MAC address of the next hop.
During this resolution, the first packet (the ping request) might be dropped because the ARP process takes some time to complete.
2. Route Convergence Delays
After configuring dynamic routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP, or BGP), routers need to exchange route updates and build their routing tables.
If the routing protocol hasn't fully converged, the router might temporarily lack a valid route to the destination.
The first ping packet might be dropped while the route is being learned or updated.
